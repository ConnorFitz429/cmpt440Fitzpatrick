"The Buddy System"

Abstract: The Buddy System is a project I made based off of the habits and decisions that my friend makes whenever he drinks.
The system contains a total of seventeen states and involves the user answering a question at each state. The system will 
either accept a '0' or a '1' as input. The purpose of the program is to see if it is likely that he will black-out based off 
of his behavior throughout the night. That being said, there are two end states. One involves him being okay and going to bed
at the end of the night, and the other involves him blacking out and/or getting sick. It can be run in a terminal or on 
eclipse. I hope you enjoy the project just as much as I enjoyed making it!
